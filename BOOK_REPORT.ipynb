      "stiff, for i feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\n",
      "to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that i\n",
      "could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but i could\n",
      "distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the\n",
      "thin, sighing note of the bank director. from my position i could look\n",
      "over the case in the direction of the floor. suddenly my eyes caught\n",
      "the glint of a light.\n",
      "\n",
      "at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. then it\n",
      "lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\n",
      "warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\n",
      "almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\n",
      "of light. for a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\n",
      "protruded out of the floor. then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\n",
      "appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\n",
      "marked a chink between the stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "its disappearance, however, was but momentary. with a rending, tearing\n",
      "sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\n",
      "left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\n",
      "lantern. over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\n",
      "looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\n",
      "aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\n",
      "rested upon the edge. in another instant he stood at the side of the\n",
      "hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\n",
      "himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it’s all clear,” he whispered. “have you the chisel and the bags?\n",
      "great scott! jump, archie, jump, and i’ll swing for it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\n",
      "the other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of rending cloth\n",
      "as jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed upon the barrel of a\n",
      "revolver, but holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and\n",
      "the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it’s no use, john clay,” said holmes blandly. “you have no chance at\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“so i see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “i fancy that\n",
      "my pal is all right, though i see you have got his coat-tails.”\n",

      "compliment you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“and i you,” holmes answered. “your red-headed idea was very new and\n",
      "effective.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you’ll see your pal again presently,” said jones. “he’s quicker at\n",
      "climbing down holes than i am. just hold out while i fix the derbies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\n",

      "when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n",
      "\n",

      "the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n",
      "\n",
      "“really, mr. holmes,” said mr. merryweather as we followed them from\n",
      "the cellar, “i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\n",
      "there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\n",
      "complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\n",
      "that have ever come within my experience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr. john\n",
      "clay,” said holmes. “i have been at some small expense over this\n",
      "matter, which i shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that i am\n",
      "amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\n",
      "and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you see, watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\n",
      "sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street, “it was perfectly\n",
      "obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\n",
      "fantastic business of the advertisement of the league, and the copying\n",
      "of the _encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\n",
      "out of the way for a number of hours every day. it was a curious way of\n",
      "managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\n",
      "the method was no doubt suggested to clay’s ingenious mind by the\n",
      "colour of his accomplice’s hair. the £ 4 a week was a lure which must\n",
      "draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? they\n",
      "put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\n",
      "rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\n",
      "secure his absence every morning in the week. from the time that i\n",
      "heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\n",
      "that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“but how could you guess what the motive was?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“had there been women in the house, i should have suspected a mere\n",
      "vulgar intrigue. that, however, was out of the question. the man’s\n",
      "business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\n",
      "could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\n",
      "as they were at. it must, then, be something out of the house. what\n",
      "could it be? i thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and\n",
      "his trick of vanishing into the cellar. the cellar! there was the end\n",
      "of this tangled clue. then i made inquiries as to this mysterious\n",
      "assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most\n",
      "daring criminals in london. he was doing something in the\n",
      "cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. what\n",
      "could it be, once more? i could think of nothing save that he was\n",
      "running a tunnel to some other building.\n",
      "\n",
      "“so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action. i\n",
      "surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. i was\n",
      "ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. it\n",
      "was not in front. then i rang the bell, and, as i hoped, the assistant\n",
      "answered it. we have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\n",
      "upon each other before. i hardly looked at his face. his knees were\n",
      "what i wished to see. you must yourself have remarked how worn,\n",
      "wrinkled, and stained they were. they spoke of those hours of\n",
      "burrowing. the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. i\n",
      "walked round the corner, saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our\n",
      "friend’s premises, and felt that i had solved my problem. when you\n",
      "drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the\n",
      "chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” i\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they\n",
      "cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson’s presence—in other words, that\n",
      "they had completed their tunnel. but it was essential that they should\n",
      "use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\n",
      "removed. saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\n",
      "would give them two days for their escape. for all these reasons i\n",
      "expected them to come to-night.”\n",
      "\n",

      "up some small points in connection with it. the husband was a\n",
      "teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\n",
      "that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\n",
      "out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\n",
      "allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\n",

      "under such obligations to turner, should still talk of marrying his son\n",
      "to turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and\n",
      "that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\n",

      "stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. his nostrils seemed\n",
      "to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\n",
      "absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\n",
      "remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\n",
      "quick, impatient snarl in reply. swiftly and silently he made his way\n",
      "along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\n",

      "“in the bathroom,” he answered. “oh, yes, i am not joking,” he\n",
      "continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “i have just been there, and\n",
      "i have taken it out, and i have got it in this gladstone bag. come on,\n",
      "my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\n",
      "bright morning sunshine. in the road stood our horse and trap, with the\n",
      "half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. we both sprang in, and away\n",
      "we dashed down the london road. a few country carts were stirring,\n",
      "bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\n",
      "either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it has been in some points a singular case,” said holmes, flicking the\n",
      "horse on into a gallop. “i confess that i have been as blind as a mole,\n",
      "but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\n",
      "their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side.\n",
      "passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river, and\n",
      "dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found\n",
      "ourselves in bow street. sherlock holmes was well known to the force,\n",
      "and the two constables at the door saluted him. one of them held the\n",
      "horse’s head while the other led us in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“who is on duty?” asked holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“inspector bradstreet, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“ah, bradstreet, how are you?” a tall, stout official had come down the\n",
      "stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “i wish to\n",
      "have a quiet word with you, bradstreet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“certainly, mr. holmes. step into my room here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\n",
      "and a telephone projecting from the wall. the inspector sat down at his\n",
      "desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“what can i do for you, mr. holmes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i called about that beggarman, boone—the one who was charged with\n",
      "being concerned in the disappearance of mr. neville st. clair, of lee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes. he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“so i heard. you have him here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“in the cells.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“is he quiet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh, he gives no trouble. but he is a dirty scoundrel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“dirty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\n",
      "as black as a tinker’s. well, when once his case has been settled, he\n",
      "will have a regular prison bath; and i think, if you saw him, you would\n",
      "agree with me that he needed it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i should like to see him very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“would you? that is easily done. come this way. you can leave your\n",
      "bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no, i think that i’ll take it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“very good. come this way, if you please.” he led us down a passage,\n",
      "opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\n",
      "whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“the third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “here it is!” he\n",
      "quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\n",
      "through.\n",
      "\n",
      "“he is asleep,” said he. “you can see him very well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "we both put our eyes to the grating. the prisoner lay with his face\n",
      "towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. he was\n",
      "a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a\n",
      "coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. he\n",
      "was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\n",
      "covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. a broad\n",
      "wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its\n",
      "contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\n",
      "teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. a shock of very bright red\n",
      "hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“he’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\n",
      "\n",
      "“he certainly needs a wash,” remarked holmes. “i had an idea that he\n",
      "might, and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” he opened\n",
      "the gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\n",
      "large bath-sponge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“he! he! you are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\n",
      "\n",
      "“now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\n",
      "quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, i don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “he doesn’t look a\n",
      "credit to the bow street cells, does he?” he slipped his key into the\n",
      "lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. the sleeper half\n",
      "turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. holmes\n",
      "stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\n",
      "twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to mr. neville st. clair, of lee,\n",
      "in the county of kent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "never in my life have i seen such a sight. the man’s face peeled off\n",
      "under the sponge like the bark from a tree. gone was the coarse brown\n",
      "tint! gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\n",
      "the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! a\n",
      "twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his\n",
      "bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\n",
      "smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy\n",
      "bewilderment. then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a\n",
      "scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.\n",
      "i know him from the photograph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\n",
      "to his destiny. “be it so,” said he. “and pray what am i charged with?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“with making away with mr. neville st.— oh, come, you can’t be charged\n",
      "with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the\n",
      "inspector with a grin. “well, i have been twenty-seven years in the\n",
      "force, but this really takes the cake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“if i am mr. neville st. clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\n",
      "been committed, and that, therefore, i am illegally detained.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said holmes.\n",
      "“you would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “god\n",
      "help me, i would not have them ashamed of their father. my god! what an\n",
      "exposure! what can i do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\n",
      "on the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he,\n",
      "“of course you can hardly avoid publicity. on the other hand, if you\n",
      "convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\n",
      "you, i do not know that there is any reason that the details should\n",
      "find their way into the papers. inspector bradstreet would, i am sure,\n",
      "make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the\n",
      "proper authorities. the case would then never go into court at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“god bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “i would have endured\n",
      "imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable\n",
      "secret as a family blot to my children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you are the first who have ever heard my story. my father was a\n",
      "schoolmaster in chesterfield, where i received an excellent education.\n",
      "i travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a\n",
      "reporter on an evening paper in london. one day my editor wished to\n",
      "have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and i\n",
      "volunteered to supply them. there was the point from which all my\n",
      "adventures started. it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i\n",
      "could get the facts upon which to base my articles. when an actor i\n",
      "had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\n",
      "famous in the green-room for my skill. i took advantage now of my\n",
      "attainments. i painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\n",
      "possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\n",
      "the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. then with a red head\n",
      "of hair, and an appropriate dress, i took my station in the business\n",
      "part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.\n",
      "for seven hours i plied my trade, and when i returned home in the\n",
      "evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26_s_.\n",
      "4_d_.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some\n",
      "time later, i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me\n",
      "for £ 25. i was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden\n",
      "idea came to me. i begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked\n",
      "for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\n",
      "city under my disguise. in ten days i had the money and had paid the\n",
      "debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work\n",
      "at £ 2 a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by\n",
      "smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\n",
      "sitting still. it was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\n",
      "the dollars won at last, and i threw up reporting and sat day after day\n",
      "in the corner which i had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\n",
      "face and filling my pockets with coppers. only one man knew my secret.\n",
      "he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam\n",
      "lane, where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\n",
      "evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. this\n",
      "fellow, a lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that i knew\n",
      "that my secret was safe in his possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money.\n",
      "i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn £ 700\n",
      "a year—which is less than my average takings—but i had exceptional\n",
      "advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\n",
      "repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised\n",
      "character in the city. all day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\n",
      "poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take\n",
      "£ 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "“as i grew richer i grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\n",
      "and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\n",
      "occupation. my dear wife knew that i had business in the city. she\n",
      "little knew what.\n",
      "\n",
      "“last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room\n",
      "above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw, to my\n",
      "horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\n",
      "her eyes fixed full upon me. i gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\n",
      "to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the lascar, entreated\n",
      "him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. i heard her voice\n",
      "downstairs, but i knew that she could not ascend. swiftly i threw off\n",
      "my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\n",
      "wig. even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. but\n",
      "then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\n",
      "that the clothes might betray me. i threw open the window, reopening by\n",
      "my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the\n",
      "bedroom that morning. then i seized my coat, which was weighted by the\n",
      "coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in\n",
      "which i carried my takings. i hurled it out of the window, and it\n",
      "disappeared into the thames. the other clothes would have followed, but\n",
      "at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\n",
      "minutes after i found, rather, i confess, to my relief, that instead of\n",
      "being identified as mr. neville st. clair, i was arrested as his\n",
      "murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. i was\n",
      "determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\n",
      "preference for a dirty face. knowing that my wife would be terribly\n",
      "anxious, i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a\n",
      "moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\n",
      "scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“good god! what a week she must have spent!”\n",

      "“the police have watched this lascar,” said inspector bradstreet, “and\n",
      "i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter\n",
      "unobserved. probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\n",
      "forgot all about it for some days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“that was it,” said holmes, nodding approvingly; “i have no doubt of\n",

      "\n",
      "“many times; but what was a fine to me?”\n",

      "\n",

      "pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\n",
      "morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. beside the couch\n",
      "was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and\n",
      "disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in\n",
      "several places. a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\n",
      "suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\n",
      "purpose of examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you are engaged,” said i; “perhaps i interrupt you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“not at all. i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my\n",
      "results. the matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in\n",

      "it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his\n",
      "crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were\n",
      "thick with the ice crystals. “i suppose,” i remarked, “that, homely as\n",
      "it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is\n",

      "miles. amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,\n",
      "every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and\n",
      "many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and\n",
      "bizarre without being criminal. we have already had experience of\n",
      "such.”\n",

      "very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was\n",
      "making his way homeward down tottenham court road. in front of him he\n",
      "saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and\n",
      "carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. as he reached the\n",
      "corner of goodge street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\n",
      "little knot of roughs. one of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on\n",
      "which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his\n",
      "head, smashed the shop window behind him. peterson had rushed forward\n",
      "to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\n",
      "having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\n",
      "uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\n",
      "vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\n",
      "tottenham court road. the roughs had also fled at the appearance of\n",
      "peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\n",
      "also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\n",
      "most unimpeachable christmas goose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“which surely he restored to their owner?”\n",
      "\n",

      "left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘h. b.’ are legible\n",
      "upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of bakers,\n",

      "convulsed. at first i thought that she had not recognised me, but as i\n",
      "bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never\n",
      "forget, ‘oh, my god! helen! it was the band! the speckled band!’ there\n",
      "was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\n",
      "her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a\n",
      "fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. i rushed out, calling\n",
      "loudly for my stepfather, and i met him hastening from his room in his\n",
      "dressing-gown. when he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\n",
      "and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\n",
      "from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\n",
      "died without having recovered her consciousness. such was the dreadful\n",
      "end of my beloved sister.”\n",

      "“one moment,” said holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and\n",
      "metallic sound? could you swear to it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. it is my\n",

      "and the creaking of an old house, i may possibly have been deceived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“was your sister dressed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no, she was in her night-dress. in her right hand was found the\n",

      "\n",
      "“showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\n",
      "alarm took place. that is important. and what conclusions did the\n",
      "coroner come to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“he investigated the case with great care, for dr. roylott’s conduct\n",
      "had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\n",
      "satisfactory cause of death. my evidence showed that the door had been\n",
      "fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\n",
      "old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\n",
      "night. the walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\n",
      "solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\n",
      "the same result. the chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\n",
      "staples. it is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\n",
      "she met her end. besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“how about poison?”\n",

      "sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\n",

      "building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that i have had to\n",
      "move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very\n",
      "bed in which she slept. imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\n",
      "night, as i lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, i suddenly\n",
      "heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\n",
      "herald of her own death. i sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was\n",
      "to be seen in the room. i was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\n",
      "so i dressed, and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down, got a\n",
      "dog-cart at the crown inn, which is opposite, and drove to leatherhead,\n",

      "the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\n",

      "professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\n",
      "frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\n",
      "his hand. so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\n",
      "the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\n",
      "side. a large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\n",

      "\n",
      "“he seems a very amiable person,” said holmes, laughing. “i am not\n",
      "quite so bulky, but if he had remained i might have shown him that my\n",
      "grip was not much more feeble than his own.” as he spoke he picked up\n",
      "the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\n",

      "her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. and now, watson, we\n",
      "shall order breakfast, and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors’\n",
      "commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in this\n",
      "matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "it was nearly one o’clock when sherlock holmes returned from his\n",
      "excursion. he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\n",
      "with notes and figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “to determine its\n",
      "exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\n",
      "investments with which it is concerned. the total income, which at the\n",
      "time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through\n",
      "the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. each daughter can\n",
      "claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. it is evident,\n",
      "therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\n",
      "mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\n",
      "serious extent. my morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has\n",
      "proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\n",
      "of anything of the sort. and now, watson, this is too serious for\n",
      "dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\n",
      "ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\n",
      "drive to waterloo. i should be very much obliged if you would slip your\n",
      "revolver into your pocket. an eley’s no. 2 is an excellent argument\n",
      "with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. that and a\n",
      "tooth-brush are, i think, all that we need.”\n",
      "\n",
      "at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead,\n",
      "where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\n",
      "miles through the lovely surrey lanes. it was a perfect day, with a\n",
      "bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. the trees and\n",
      "wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\n",
      "air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. to me at least\n",
      "there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\n",
      "and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. my companion sat in\n",
      "the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\n",
      "eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\n",
      "suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\n",
      "over the meadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“look there!” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\n",
      "a grove at the highest point. from amid the branches there jutted out\n",
      "the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“stoke moran?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, sir, that be the house of dr. grimesby roylott,” remarked the\n",
      "driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“there is some building going on there,” said holmes; “that is where we\n",
      "are going.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“there’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\n",
      "some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll\n",
      "find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\n",
      "fields. there it is, where the lady is walking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“and the lady, i fancy, is miss stoner,” observed holmes, shading his\n",
      "eyes. “yes, i think we had better do as you suggest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "we got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\n",
      "leatherhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i thought it as well,” said holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this\n",
      "fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\n",
      "business. it may stop his gossip. good-afternoon, miss stoner. you see\n",
      "that we have been as good as our word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\n",
      "which spoke her joy. “i have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she\n",
      "cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “all has turned out splendidly.\n",
      "dr. roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\n",
      "before evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“we have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said\n",
      "holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. miss\n",
      "stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“so it appears.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him. what will\n",
      "he say when he returns?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“he must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\n",
      "cunning than himself upon his track. you must lock yourself up from him\n",
      "to-night. if he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\n",
      "harrow. now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\n",
      "at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\n",
      "portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\n",
      "each side. in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\n",
      "with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\n",
      "ruin. the central portion was in little better repair, but the\n",
      "right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\n",
      "windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\n",
      "this was where the family resided. some scaffolding had been erected\n",
      "against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\n",
      "there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. holmes\n",
      "walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\n",
      "attention the outsides of the windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“this, i take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\n",

      "dr. roylott’s chamber?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“exactly so. but i am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“pending the alterations, as i understand. by the way, there does not\n",
      "seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“there were none. i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\n",
      "room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“ah! that is suggestive. now, on the other side of this narrow wing\n",
      "runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. there are windows\n",
      "in it, of course?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, but very small ones. too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“as you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\n",
      "from that side. now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\n",
      "and bar your shutters?”\n",
      "\n",
      "miss stoner did so, and holmes, after a careful examination through the\n",
      "open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\n",
      "without success. there was no slit through which a knife could be\n",
      "passed to raise the bar. then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\n",
      "they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “hum!”\n",
      "said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly\n",
      "presents some difficulties. no one could pass these shutters if they\n",

      "matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\n",

      "we passed at once to the second, that in which miss stoner was now\n",
      "sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. it was a\n",
      "homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\n",
      "the fashion of old country-houses. a brown chest of drawers stood in\n",
      "one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\n",

      "and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\n",
      "the house. holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\n",

      "and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\n",
      "between the boards. then he did the same with the wood-work with which\n",
      "the chamber was panelled. finally he walked over to the bed and spent\n",

      "\n",
      "“very strange!” muttered holmes, pulling at the rope. “there are one or\n",

      "beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\n",
      "and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\n",

      "“subtle enough and horrible enough. when a doctor does go wrong he is\n",

      "about nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\n",

      "light shone out right in front of us.\n",

      "that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\n",

      "out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\n",

      "sombre errand.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\n",
      "breaches gaped in the old park wall. making our way among the trees, we\n",
      "reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\n",
      "window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\n",
      "to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\n",
      "with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\n",
      "darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“my god!” i whispered; “did you see it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "holmes was for the moment as startled as i. his hand closed like a vice\n",
      "upon my wrist in his agitation. then he broke into a low laugh and put\n",

      "\n",
      "“it is a nice household,” he murmured. “that is the baboon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. there was a\n",
      "cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\n",
      "moment. i confess that i felt easier in my mind when, after following\n",
      "holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, i found myself inside the\n",
      "bedroom. my companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\n",
      "onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. all was as we had\n",
      "seen it in the daytime. then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\n",
      "his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\n",
      "i could do to distinguish the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“the least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i nodded to show that i had heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“we must sit without light. he would see it through the ventilator.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i nodded again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. have your pistol\n",
      "ready in case we should need it. i will sit on the side of the bed, and\n",
      "you in that chair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\n",
      "beside him. by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\n",
      "then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil? i could not hear a sound,\n",
      "not even the drawing of a breath, and yet i knew that my companion sat\n",
      "open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\n",
      "tension in which i was myself. the shutters cut off the least ray of\n",
      "light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "from outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\n",
      "very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\n",
      "was indeed at liberty. far away we could hear the deep tones of the\n",
      "parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. how long they\n",
      "seemed, those quarters! twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\n",
      "still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\n",
      "of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\n",
      "strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. someone in the next room\n",
      "had lit a dark-lantern. i heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\n",
      "all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. for half an\n",
      "hour i sat with straining ears. then suddenly another sound became\n",
      "audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\n",
      "steam escaping continually from a kettle. the instant that we heard it,\n",
      "holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\n",
      "his cane at the bell-pull.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you see it, watson?” he yelled. “you see it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "but i saw nothing. at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a\n",
      "low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\n",
      "made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\n",
      "so savagely. i could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\n",
      "filled with horror and loathing. he had ceased to strike and was gazing\n",
      "up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\n",
      "night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened. it swelled\n",
      "up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\n",
      "mingled in the one dreadful shriek. they say that away down in the\n",
      "village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\n",
      "sleepers from their beds. it struck cold to our hearts, and i stood\n",
      "gazing at holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\n",
      "away into the silence from which it rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“what can it mean?” i gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it means that it is all over,” holmes answered. “and perhaps, after\n",
      "all, it is for the best. take your pistol, and we will enter dr.\n",
      "roylott’s room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\n",
      "twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. then\n",
      "he turned the handle and entered, i at his heels, with the cocked\n",
      "pistol in my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a singular sight which met our eyes. on the table stood a\n",
      "dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\n",
      "light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. beside this\n",
      "table, on the wooden chair, sat dr. grimesby roylott clad in a long\n",
      "grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\n",
      "thrust into red heelless turkish slippers. across his lap lay the short\n",
      "stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. his chin\n",
      "was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\n",
      "the corner of the ceiling. round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\n",
      "band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\n",
      "his head. as we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“the band! the speckled band!” whispered holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "i took a step forward. in an instant his strange headgear began to\n",
      "move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\n",
      "diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it is a swamp adder!” cried holmes; “the deadliest snake in india. he\n",
      "has died within ten seconds of being bitten. violence does, in truth,\n",
      "recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\n",
      "digs for another. let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\n",
      "can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\n",
      "police know what has happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\n",
      "throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\n",
      "perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\n",
      "which he closed upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "such are the true facts of the death of dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke\n",
      "moran. it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has\n",
      "already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\n",
      "to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\n",
      "care of her good aunt at harrow, of how the slow process of official\n",

      "forward and peering at us. i could see that she was pretty, and from\n",
      "the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it\n",

      "hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\n",
      "shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. it was a wonderfully\n",
      "silent house. there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\n",

      "where was the place? i was ten miles or so from eyford, that was all i\n",

      "weight would come upon my spine, and i shuddered to think of that\n",
      "dreadful snap. easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had i the nerve\n",

      "“there you are,” said he. “that circle is drawn at a radius of ten\n",

      "\n",
      "“none at all,” said holmes. “they are coiners on a large scale, and\n",

      "“a house on fire?” asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on\n",
      "its way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, sir!” said the station-master.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“whose house is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“dr. becher’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is dr. becher a german, very thin,\n",
      "with a long, sharp nose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "the station-master laughed heartily. “no, sir, dr. becher is an\n",
      "englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\n",
      "waistcoat. but he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as i\n",
      "understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\n",
      "berkshire beef would do him no harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\n",
      "hastening in the direction of the fire. the road topped a low hill, and\n",
      "there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\n",
      "spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\n",
      "three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\n",
      "\n",
      "“that’s it!” cried hatherley, in intense excitement. “there is the\n",
      "gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where i lay. that second\n",
      "window is the one that i jumped from.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, at least,” said holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.\n",
      "there can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\n",
      "crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\n",
      "they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\n",

      "though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "and holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no\n",
      "word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\n",
      "german, or the morose englishman. early that morning a peasant had met\n",
      "a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\n",
      "rapidly in the direction of reading, but there all traces of the\n",
      "fugitives disappeared, and even holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to\n",
      "discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\n",
      "they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\n",
      "human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. about sunset,\n",
      "however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\n",
      "flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\n",
      "reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\n",
      "iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\n",
      "unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. large masses of nickel and of tin\n",
      "were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\n",
      "which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\n",
      "been already referred to.\n",
      "\n",
      "how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\n",
      "spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\n",
      "mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\n",
      "tale. he had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\n",
      "had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. on the\n",
      "whole, it was most probable that the silent englishman, being less bold\n",
      "or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\n",
      "the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once\n",

      "whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\n",
      "breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\n",
      "our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\n",
      "hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\n",
      "desultory chat with me over his business affairs. a short railway\n",

      "little from the road. a double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\n",
      "stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\n",
      "entrance. on the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\n",
      "a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\n",
      "kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. on the left ran a\n",
      "lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\n",

      "standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\n",
      "front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind\n",
      "into the stable lane. so long was he that mr. holder and i went into\n",
      "the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. we were\n",
      "sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\n",
      "she was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\n",
      "which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. i do\n",
      "not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.\n",
      "her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\n",
      "as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\n",
      "sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\n",
      "more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\n",
      "with immense capacity for self-restraint. disregarding my presence, she\n",
      "went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\n",
      "sweet womanly caress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you have given orders that arthur should be liberated, have you not,\n",

      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“there was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\n",
      "line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. i was\n",

      "son. the first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\n",
      "as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\n",
      "was obvious that he had passed after the other. i followed them up and\n",
      "found they led to the hall window, where boots had worn all the snow\n",
      "away while waiting. then i walked to the other end, which was a hundred\n",
      "yards or more down the lane. i saw where boots had faced round, where\n",
      "the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\n",
      "where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that i was not\n",
      "mistaken. boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\n",
      "of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. when he came to the\n",
      "high road at the other end, i found that the pavement had been cleared,\n",
      "so there was an end to that clue.\n",

      "better fit if i had been measured for it. both mr. and mrs. rucastle\n",

      "in its vehemence. they were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\n",
      "is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\n",
      "with three long windows reaching down to the floor. a chair had been\n",

      "this i was asked to sit, and then mr. rucastle, walking up and down on\n",
      "the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\n",

      "has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with\n",
      "her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. after an\n",
      "hour or so, mr. rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\n",

      "my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\n",
      "then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\n",
      "sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\n",
      "to read aloud to him. i read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\n",

      "window, so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going\n",
      "on behind my back. at first it seemed to be impossible, but i soon\n",
      "devised a means. my hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\n",
      "seized me, and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. on\n",
      "the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, i put my handkerchief\n",
      "up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\n",
      "there was behind me. i confess that i was disappointed. there was\n",
      "nothing. at least that was my first impression. at the second glance,\n",
      "however, i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton\n",
      "road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\n",
      "my direction. the road is an important highway, and there are usually\n",
      "people there. this man, however, was leaning against the railings which\n",
      "bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. i lowered my\n",
      "handkerchief and glanced at mrs. rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon\n",
      "me with a most searching gaze. she said nothing, but i am convinced\n",

      "me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. as we\n",

      "as much as your life is worth.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“the warning was no idle one, for two nights later i happened to look\n",
      "out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. it was a\n",
      "beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\n",
      "silvered over and almost as bright as day. i was standing, rapt in the\n",
      "peaceful beauty of the scene, when i was aware that something was\n",

      "moonshine i saw what it was. it was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\n",
      "tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\n",
      "bones. it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\n",
      "upon the other side. that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\n",

      "\n",
      "“and now i have a very strange experience to tell you. i had, as you\n",

      "the bottom of my trunk. one evening, after the child was in bed, i\n",
      "began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\n",
      "rearranging my own little things. there was an old chest of drawers in\n",
      "the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. i\n",
      "had filled the first two with my linen, and as i had still much to pack\n",
      "away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.\n",
      "it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so i\n",
      "took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. the very first key\n",
      "fitted to perfection, and i drew the drawer open. there was only one\n",
      "thing in it, but i am sure that you would never guess what it was. it\n",
      "was my coil of hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i took it up and examined it. it was of the same peculiar tint, and\n",
      "the same thickness. but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\n",
      "itself upon me. how could my hair have been locked in the drawer? with\n",
      "trembling hands i undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\n",
      "from the bottom my own hair. i laid the two tresses together, and i\n",
      "assure you that they were identical. was it not extraordinary? puzzle\n",
      "as i would, i could make nothing at all of what it meant. i returned\n",
      "the strange hair to the drawer, and i said nothing of the matter to the\n",
      "rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a\n",
      "drawer which they had locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, mr. holmes, and i\n",
      "soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. there was\n",
      "one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. a door\n",
      "which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into\n",
      "this suite, but it was invariably locked. one day, however, as i\n",
      "ascended the stair, i met mr. rucastle coming out through this door,\n",
      "his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\n",
      "different person to the round, jovial man to whom i was accustomed. his\n",
      "cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\n",
      "stood out at his temples with passion. he locked the door and hurried\n",
      "past me without a word or a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "“this aroused my curiosity, so when i went out for a walk in the\n",
      "grounds with my charge, i strolled round to the side from which i could\n",
      "see the windows of this part of the house. there were four of them in a\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if i passed you without a\n",
      "word, my dear young lady. i was preoccupied with business matters.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“i assured him that i was not offended. ‘by the way,’ said i, ‘you seem\n",

      "shutters up.’\n",
      "\n",

      "remark.\n",

      "up there. but, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\n",
      "who would have believed it? who would have ever believed it?’ he spoke\n",
      "in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\n",
      "me. i read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, mr. holmes, from the moment that i understood that there was\n",
      "something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know, i was all\n",
      "on fire to go over them. it was not mere curiosity, though i have my\n",
      "share of that. it was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good\n",
      "might come from my penetrating to this place. they talk of woman’s\n",
      "instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.\n",
      "at any rate, it was there, and i was keenly on the lookout for any\n",
      "chance to pass the forbidden door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it was only yesterday that the chance came. i may tell you that,\n",
      "besides mr. rucastle, both toller and his wife find something to do in\n",
      "these deserted rooms, and i once saw him carrying a large black linen\n",
      "bag with him through the door. recently he has been drinking hard, and\n",
      "yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when i came upstairs there was\n",
      "the key in the door. i have no doubt at all that he had left it there.\n",
      "mr. and mrs. rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with\n",
      "them, so that i had an admirable opportunity. i turned the key gently\n",
      "in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n",
      "\n",
      "“there was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\n",
      "which turned at a right angle at the farther end. round this corner\n",
      "were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\n",
      "they each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\n",
      "in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\n",
      "light glimmered dimly through them. the centre door was closed, and\n",
      "across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an\n",
      "iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at\n",
      "the other with stout cord. the door itself was locked as well, and the\n",
      "key was not there. this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\n",
      "shuttered window outside, and yet i could see by the glimmer from\n",
      "beneath it that the room was not in darkness. evidently there was a\n",
      "skylight which let in light from above. as i stood in the passage\n",
      "gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, i\n",
      "suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass\n",
      "backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\n",
      "out from under the door. a mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\n",
      "sight, mr. holmes. my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and i\n",
      "turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\n",
      "clutching at the skirt of my dress. i rushed down the passage, through\n",
      "the door, and straight into the arms of mr. rucastle, who was waiting\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘so,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. i thought that it must be\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘oh, i am so frightened!’ i panted.\n",
      "\n",

      "dear young lady?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“but his voice was just a little too coaxing. he overdid it. i was\n",
      "keenly on my guard against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ i answered. ‘but it\n",

      "out again. oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘why, what did you think?’ i asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘why do you think that i lock this door?’\n",

      "“‘i am sure that i do not know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘it is to keep people out who have no business there. do you see?’ he\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘i am sure if i had known—’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘well, then, you know now. and if you ever put your foot over that\n",
      "threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\n",
      "rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘i’ll throw you\n",
      "to the mastiff.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“i was so terrified that i do not know what i did. i suppose that i\n",
      "must have rushed past him into my room. i remember nothing until i\n",
      "found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. then i thought of you,\n",
      "mr. holmes. i could not live there longer without some advice. i was\n",
      "frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\n",
      "even of the child. they were all horrible to me. if i could only bring\n",
      "you down all would be well. of course i might have fled from the house,\n",
      "but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. my mind was soon\n",
      "made up. i would send you a wire. i put on my hat and cloak, went down\n",
      "to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\n",
      "returned, feeling very much easier. a horrible doubt came into my mind\n",
      "as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but i remembered\n",
      "that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\n",
      "evening, and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had\n",
      "any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\n",
      "free. i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\n",
      "the thought of seeing you. i had no difficulty in getting leave to come\n",
      "into winchester this morning, but i must be back before three o’clock,\n",
      "for mr. and mrs. rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\n",
      "the evening, so that i must look after the child. now i have told you\n",
      "all my adventures, mr. holmes, and i should be very glad if you could\n",
      "tell me what it all means, and, above all, what i should do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. my\n",
      "friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\n",
      "pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“is toller still drunk?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes. i heard his wife tell mrs. rucastle that she could do nothing\n",

      "that is obvious. as to who this prisoner is, i have no doubt that it is\n",
      "the daughter, miss alice rucastle, if i remember right, who was said to\n",
      "have gone to america. you were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in\n",
      "height, figure, and the colour of your hair. hers had been cut off,\n",
      "very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\n",
      "course, yours had to be sacrificed also. by a curious chance you came\n",
      "upon her tresses. the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of\n",
      "hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress\n",
      "and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he\n",
      "saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that miss rucastle was\n",
      "perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. the dog\n",
      "is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\n",
      "with her. so much is fairly clear. the most serious point in the case\n",
      "is the disposition of the child.”\n",
      "\n",

      "that the converse is equally valid. i have frequently gained my first\n",
      "real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\n",
      "this child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s\n",
      "sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as i should\n",

      "their power.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i am sure that you are right, mr. holmes,” cried our client. “a\n",

      "\n",
      "a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “that is mrs.\n",

      "\n",

      "the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\n",

      "\n",
      "“you villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\n",

      "baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\n",
      "sound which it was dreadful to listen to. an elderly man with a red\n",
      "face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“my god!” he cried. “someone has loosed the dog. it’s not been fed for\n",
      "two days. quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\n",
      "\n",
      "holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house, with toller\n",

      "buried in rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\n",
      "ground. running up, i blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\n",
      "keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. with\n",
      "much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\n",
      "mangled, into the house. we laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\n",
      "having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife, i\n",
      "did what i could to relieve his pain. we were all assembled round him\n",

      "planning, for i would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“ha!” said holmes, looking keenly at her. “it is clear that mrs. toller\n",
      "knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, sir, i do, and i am ready enough to tell what i know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points\n",
      "on which i must confess that i am still in the dark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and i’d have done so\n",
      "before now if i could ha’ got out from the cellar. if there’s\n",
      "police-court business over this, you’ll remember that i was the one\n",

      "\n",
      "“she was never happy at home, miss alice wasn’t, from the time that her\n",

      "but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr. fowler\n",
      "at a friend’s house. as well as i could learn, miss alice had rights of\n",
      "her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\n",
      "never said a word about them but just left everything in mr. rucastle’s\n",
      "hands. he knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\n",
      "husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\n",
      "him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. he wanted her\n",
      "to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\n",
      "money. when she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\n",
      "brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. then she got better\n",
      "at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\n",
      "that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\n",
      "true as man could be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“ah,” said holmes, “i think that what you have been good enough to tell\n",
      "us makes the matter fairly clear, and that i can deduce all that\n",
      "remains. mr. rucastle then, i presume, took to this system of\n",
      "imprisonment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the\n",

      "\n",
      "“that was it, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“but mr. fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\n",
      "blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\n",

      "same as his.”\n",

      "“mr. fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said mrs.\n",
